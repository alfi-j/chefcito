# Date Object Serialization Fix

## Problem

We encountered an error in the KDS (Kitchen Display System) where `order.createdAt.getTime is not a function`. This error occurred because:

1. The Order type defines [createdAt](file://c:\Users\AJ\Documents\Projects\chefcito-master\src\lib\types.ts#L47-L47) as a Date object
2. When orders are sent through the API, they are serialized using JSON
3. During JSON serialization, Date objects are converted to strings
4. When the data is received on the client side, it's not automatically converted back to Date objects
5. The OrderCard component tried to call [getTime()](file://c:\Users\AJ\Documents\Projects\chefcito-master\src\lib\types.ts#L122-L122) on a string, which caused the error

## Solution

We implemented a fix in the [useOrders](file://c:\Users\AJ\Documents\Projects\chefcito-master\src\hooks\use-orders.ts#L13-L203) hook to properly convert date strings back to Date objects:

1. Added a `convertOrderDates` function that:
   - Takes the raw order data from the API
   - Converts the [createdAt](file://c:\Users\AJ\Documents\Projects\chefcito-master\src\lib\types.ts#L47-L47) string back to a Date object
   - Converts the [completedAt](file://c:\Users\AJ\Documents\Projects\chefcito-master\src\lib\types.ts#L48-L48) string back to a Date object (if it exists)
   - Ensures proper structure for nested items

2. Modified the [fetchOrders](file://c:\Users\AJ\Documents\Projects\chefcito-master\src\hooks\use-orders.ts#L21-L37) function to:
   - Apply the date conversion to all fetched orders
   - Ensure that Date objects are properly instantiated before being used in components

## Files Modified

- `src/hooks/use-orders.ts` - Added date conversion logic

## Verification

The fix has been verified by:
- ✅ Starting the development server without errors
- ✅ Loading the KDS page without the TypeError
- ✅ Confirming that order cards display time information correctly
- ✅ Verifying that all API routes continue to function properly

## Technical Details

This is a common issue when working with REST APIs and Date objects. JSON serialization converts Date objects to ISO strings, but the deserialization process doesn't automatically convert them back. This requires explicit handling on the client side.

The fix ensures that:
1. Date objects maintain their methods (like [getTime()](file://c:\Users\AJ\Documents\Projects\chefcito-master\src\lib\types.ts#L122-L122))
2. Components that depend on Date methods continue to work correctly
3. The application maintains type safety
4. No breaking changes to the existing API structure

This fix resolves the immediate error and prevents similar issues with other Date fields that might be added in the future.
